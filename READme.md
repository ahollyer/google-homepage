# My First HTML/CSS Project

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)

This is my first attempt at replicating the look and feel of the Google Homepage using HTML & CSS. I'm trying to follow best practices and learn how to track changes using Git/GitHub, too. I look forward to learning, growing, and enhancing my coding skills in the near future!

If you have any tips or want to learn together, shoot me an e-mail at aspen.dollins@gmail.com
